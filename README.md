## 👋 About Me  
Hi! I'm **Raghuveer** ✨  
🥘 Culture Enthusiast | 📖 Storyteller-at-Heart | 🎶 Carnatic Music Lover | 🥑 Fasting Newbie  

I built this app to merge my love for **community-driven rituals** (hello, South Indian family WhatsApp groups!) with tech. Fasting’s always been a cultural cornerstone for me, and I wanted to make it fun, social, and slightly competitive — because who doesn’t love a good taunting emoji war?

## 🌟 Why My Fasting Friends?  
Sticking to fasting goals alone is tough. This app brings friends together to:  
- **Track progress** with Apple Fitness-style rings 🎯  
- **Compete** on a real-time leaderboard 🏆  
- **Shower each other** with 👏, 😂, or (friendly) taunts via WhatsApp 💬  

Think of it as *"Strava for intermittent fasting"* — but with more humor and fewer Lycra shorts.
