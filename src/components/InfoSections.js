          Our fasting challenges allow you to invite your friends and track your progress together. 
          Taunt them when they're lagging or breaking rules. Clap when they're going beyond and above. 
          Overall, be a real accountability partner and get the results you desired.

        <p>
          You might be wondering why penguins? Because they're known to fast for up to 120 days, 
          despite being in the harshest winters and they do it because they do it together. 
          Huddle in massive colonies for warmth.
